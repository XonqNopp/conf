INTRODUCTION *openssl* *openssl.vim*
If you do not know anything about encrypted files, you should first learn the
basis (see on the internet).

If you know about encryption but not about this plugin, see the little
|openssl-tutorial| in this help file.

REQUIREMENTS *openssl-requirements*
This script requires an external feature: OpenSSL

COMMANDS *openssl-commands*
There is no command, everything is done with autocmd according to the file
extension...

CONFIGURATION *openssl-configuration*

g:openssl_encrypted_loaded *g:openssl-encrypted-loaded*
    set it to 1 in your |vimrc| if you don't want to load |openssl|

g:openssl_version *g:openssl-version*
    |openssl| version

g:openssl_diff_pwd *g:openssl_diff_pwd*
!!NOT WORKING YET!!
    This should be set to one if you want to be sure the new password is
    different from the old one. Default is 0.

g:openssl_timeout *g:openssl_timeout*
    THis is the timeout before quitting an encrypted file
    !WITHOUT SAVING!
    default: 60 [sec]
    Set it to 0 to disable it


TUTORIAL *openssl-tutorial*

This plugin enables reading and writing of files encrypted using OpenSSL.
The file must have the extension of one of the ciphers used by OpenSSL.
For example:

   .aes .bf .bfa .idea .cast .rc2 .rc4 .rc5

For a complete list, see the manpage of openssl.

This will turn off the swap file and the .viminfo log. The `openssl` command
line tool must be in the path.

You can start by editing an empty unencrypted file. Give it one of the
extensions above. When you write the file you will be asked to give it a new
password.

== Simple Vim Password Safe == *openssl-tutorial-simple*

If you edit any file named '.auth.aes' (that's the full name, not just the
extension) then this plugin will add folding features and an automatic quit
timeout.

Vim will quit automatically after 5 minutes of no typing activity (unless
the file has been changed).

This plugin will fold on wiki-style headlines in the following format: >

    == This is a headline ==
<
Any notes under the headline will be inside the fold until the next headline
is reached. The SPACE key will toggle a fold open and closed. The q key will
quit Vim. Create the following example file named ~/.auth.aes: >

    == Colo server ==

    username: maryjane password: esydpm

    == Office server ==

    username: peter password: 4m4z1ng
<
Then create this bash alias: >
    alias auth='view ~/.auth.aes'
<
Now you can view your password safe by typing 'auth'. When Vim starts all
the password information will be hidden under the headlines. To view the
password information put the cursor on the headline and press SPACE. When
you write an encrypted file a backup will automatically be made.
