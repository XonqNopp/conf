COMMANDS *FoldImproved-commands*

FoldImproved() *FoldImproved()*
    This is the function that gives back the fold text. At the beginning is
    the following statement: >
        set foldtext=FoldImproved()
<   so that it is defined for each buffer.


CONFIGURATION *FoldImproved-configuration*

g:loaded_FoldImproved *g:loaded_FoldImproved*
    set it to 1 in your |vimrc| if you don't want to load
    |FoldImproved|. This won't prevent thet foldtext to be set to this
    function, so you should better not touch this parameter.

g:FoldImproved_version *g:FoldImproved_version*
    |FoldImproved| version

g:FoldImprovedEnable *g:FoldImprovedEnable*
    If set to 0, disables the foldtextx=FoldImproved() setting.
    Default is enabled.

g:FoldImprovedLocal *g:FoldImprovedLocal*
    If set to 1, sets foldtext=FoldImproved local to buffer.
    Should be used together with |b:FoldImprovedEnable|.
    Default is 0.

b:FoldImprovedEnable *b:FoldImprovedEnable*
    Buffer variable to enable FoldImproved only with some files.
    Can be set in a local configuration file, or in ftplugin files for
    instance. WARNING: |g:FoldImprovedEnable| superseeds this choice, so it
    has to be set to 0.
    Default is unused.
