DESCRIPTION:
   Allows controlling iTunes on Macintosh from within Vim.
   Adds a menu "iTunes" that contains various commands to
   control iTunes.
   Additionally, if the global variable "VimITunesMapPrefix" is
   set when this plugin is loaded, then several useful maps
   are created.  For example, if in your ".vimrc" you have

      let g:VimITunesMapPrefix = ",x"    *g:VimITunesMapPrefix*

   then after this plugin is loaded, you can use the following maps:

          ,xq    Quit iTunes                   *,xq* *iTunes_quit*

          ,xs    Toggle Shuffle Mode           *,xs* *iTunes_shuffle*
          ,xp    Toggle Pause Mode             *,xp* *iTunes_pause*

          ,xl    Next Song                     *,xl* *iTunes_next*
          ,xh    Previous Song                 *,xh* *iTunes_previous*

          ,xk    Volume Up                     *,xk* *iTunes_volume*
          ,xj    Volume Down                   *,xj*
          ,xm    Mute                          *,xm*
          ,x?    Display Song Title            *,x?* *iTunes_title*

          ,xd    Disable the current song      *,xd* *iTunes_disable*
          ,xe    Enable the current song       *,xe* *iTunes_enable*

BUGS:
    Can lock up if used while iTunes is shutting down (i.e.,
    if you issue a VimITunes command within approx. 10 seconds
    after telling iTunes to quit).  This appears to be a bug
    in osascript (supplied by Apple), and not this script.
