*aux2tags.txt* Create tags from LaTeX aux file

TeXtags [filename] *TeXtags*
    Create the tags file for filename.tex using the aux file *requires to have
    run LaTeX before). If no filename is provided, uses the current.
    (Works only if the same directory as the file edited.)

    If your LaTeX source is split among several files, the script works well
    with \include{file} commands, but NOT with \input file commands.

    Using tags:  If many of your labels look like \label{eqn:foo} then try
        :tag eqn:foo
        :tag eqn:<Tab>
        :tag /eqn
        :ts
    for example.  Also try :ptag variants.  For details, read
        :help tagsearch.txt
    If you want to use <C-]> to jump to tags, either use the Visual-mode variant
    or make sure that your labels are recognized as words.  For example, with
    the format \label{eqn:foo}, make sure that ":" is included in 'isk'.
