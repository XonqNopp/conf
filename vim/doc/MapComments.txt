INTRODUCTION *MapComments* *MapComments.vim*
    This plugin enables mapping on 2 keys to (un)comment a bunch of text.

    It is assumed that we have the following definitions (assuming we comment
    lines with the character # or with /*...*/):

    A line is COMMENTED OUT if it has the form >
    #echo "hello world"
    ##echo "hello world"
    ###echo "hello world"
    ####echo "hello world"
    /*echo "hello world"*/
    /*/*echo "hello world"*/*/
    /*/*/*echo "hello world"*/*/*/
    /*/*/*/*echo "hello world"*/*/*/*/
<
    and so on.

    A line is A COMMENT (i.e. no code) if it has the form >
    ## This is no code
    /***This is no code***/
<
