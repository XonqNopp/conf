INTRODUCTION *EscapeBchars* *EscapeBchars.vim*
This plugin is mainly used in |FoldImproved| and |MapComments| to escape the
characters which need. Since both of these plugins use the |ComChars|, they
are also described in the present document.


REQUIREMENTS *EscapeBchars-requirements*
Vim


COMMANDS *EscapeBchars-commands*

EscapeBchars() *EscapeBchars()*
    Returns the com char with backalsashes to escape sensible
    characters.
    Can be called as >
  EscapeBchars( b:ComChar )
<   or >
  EscapeBchars( b:ComCharOne, b:ComCharOneMore, number )
<   where One can be Start or Stop and number is > 0 for Start and 
    < 0 for Stop to enable adding the magic * regexp char
    at the right place. >
    switch( number ) {
        case 1: the More character will be included in the string
                with a regexp '*'
        case 2: the More character will be excluded from the string.
        case 3: the same as for 1 but with escaped brackets to
                make a group around the part within the start and stop.
        case 4: the same as for 2 but with escaped brackets to
                make a group around the part within the start and stop.
    }

CONFIGURATION *EscapeBchars-configuration*

g:loaded_EscapeBchars *g:loaded_EscapeBchars*
    set it to 1 in your |vimrc| if you don't want to load |EscapeBchars|

g:EscapeBchars_version *g:EscapeBchars_version*
    |EscapeBchars| version

ComChars *ComChars*
    At least |b:ComChar| or (|b:ComCharStart| and |b:ComCharStop|) must be
    defined. I suggest you to define them in the ftplugin files since they
    depend upon the filetype. If they are not defined, the default is
    using only |b:ComChar| = #
    These characters are also used with the |FoldImproved| plugin to be
    removed in the foldtext.

b:ComChar *b:ComChar*
    The <buffer> character used for comments. This is used for single-line
    comments. If |b:ComCharStart| and |b:ComCharStop| are not defined, this is
    also used for range of lines.

b:ComCharStart *b:ComCharStart*
b:ComCharStop  *b:ComCharStop*
    These are the <buffer> characters used to comment out a bunch of lines.
    If |b:ComChar| is not defined, these are used to comment out each line.
