== Edit OpenSSL encrypted files and turn Vim into a Password Safe! ==

This plugin enables reading and writing of files encrypted using OpenSSL.
The file must have the extension of one of the ciphers used by OpenSSL. For
example:

   .des3 .aes .bf .bfa .idea .cast .rc2 .rc4 .rc5

This will turn off the swap file and .viminfo log. The `openssl` command
line tool must be in the path.

== Install ==

Put this in your plugin directory and Vim will automatically load it:

   ~/.vim/plugin/openssl.vim

You can start by editing an empty unencrypted file. Give it one of the
extensions above. When you write the file you will be asked to give it a new
password.

== Simple Vim Password Safe ==

If you edit any file named '.auth.bfa' (that's the full name, not just the
extension) then this plugin will add folding features and an automatic quit
timeout.

Vim will quit automatically after 5 minutes of no typing activity (unless
the file has been changed).

This plugin will fold on wiki-style headlines in the following format:

    == This is a headline ==

Any notes under the headline will be inside the fold until the next headline
is reached. The SPACE key will toggle a fold open and closed. The q key will
quit Vim. Create the following example file named ~/.auth.des3:

    == Colo server ==

    username: maryjane password: esydpm

    == Office server ==

    username: peter password: 4m4z1ng

Then create this bash alias:

    alias auth='view ~/.auth.des3'

Now you can view your password safe by typing 'auth'. When Vim starts all
the password information will be hidden under the headlines. To view the
password information put the cursor on the headline and press SPACE.
